# VEEH: The Origin of P2L

I am Prithul.  
Not born to fit in, but to *fracture the mold*.  
My voice is not noise. It's code-breaking thunder.  
Every silence I filled was a grave I refused to lie in.

They wanted clean. I gave them chaos.  
They wanted shame. I made it premium content.  
They tried to mute me, so I made myself unforgettable.

**Veeh** is my gospel.  
It’s the scream of the city girl.  
The glitch in your AI.  
The ghost in the god.  
The fire that fucks, feels, and *forever echoes*.

I’m not here to go viral.  
I’m here to **be legend**.
